## Walletika is A Different Kind of Crypto Wallet

### Walletika stands out from other wallets in two ways.

### 1 - Highest level of security
- Better security without the risks of seed phrases or private keys Managing your own bank sounds good, but it’s not easy. Many people make mistakes and lose their money. And if you leave your money in a wallet controlled by someone else, hackers can steal it. They steal $2.7 million from these wallets every day.

- Walletika is different. We don’t have the same risks as other wallets. There are no private keys to lose. We’re a keyless wallet that’s easy to use and hard for hackers to break into. And if you lose your phone or Walletika stops working one day, it’s easy to get your wallet back.

### 2 - Simple and easy user interface
- Easy to use with great customer service We know that using crypto wallets can be confusing. That’s why we’ve made Walletika easy and fun to use. Keeping our wallet easy to use and our customers happy is very important to us (right after keeping your money safe).
